  <h1>Guild</h1>
  <p>A Guild  is a type of organization in Fiore, characterised by a member base and common trade. The purpose of a guild is to obtain and disseminate job requests to the members of the guild.</p>
</article>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>There</strong> Are Three different types of Guilds:Dark,Legal,and Indenpent. A Legal Guild is one that has been approve and registed by the Magic Council and is treated as an criminal oraganization. While An Independent Guild is one that is not approved by the Magic Council, but at the same time is not considered a criminal organization. But Very Little is currently shown about  Independent Guilds, though it appears that they can do anything they please as long as the Magic Council doesn't disapprove of the actions</p>
<p>Aside from Magic Guilds, there are variety of other guilds, such as merchant, mercenary, treasure hunter, and even bandit guilds. Happy once implied that there are workmen guilds, too. Mavis Vermilion also once mentioned that there are also combat and industrial guilds dotting the countryside. In general, guilds are formed for individuals to take Jobs and earn Jewels. Legal Guilds also work to defend against Dark Mages and other criminals; Independent guilds likewise fight illicit guilds.

In the past, Guild Wars were common as Legal Guilds fought over commercial rights, land and establishments. At the end of the Second Trade War, the Magic Council passed the Interguild Dispute Interdiction Treaty that forbids all acts of aggression against other guilds.

The total number of guilds in the continent of Ishgar is 500. In comparison, the Western Continent has 730 guilds (including Dark Guilds) which have also united into a single, centralized and militaristic Alvarez Empire.</p>
<h3>GuildRankings</h3>
<hr>
<h4>GuildMaster</h4>
<p><strong>A</strong>
Guild Master is a Mage who is the head of the guild that he or she is affiliated with. Typically, Guild Masters are very powerful, often being the strongest Mage in their guilds. Occasionally, they are even members of the Ten Wizard Saints, as with the case of Makarov Dreyar. As the heads of their own respective guilds, they virtually have complete authority over their subordinates, and can thus dictate their actions. As such, they are able to excommunicate members of their guilds or even reappoint them as an official member, as seen with Laxus. They also have the power to decide who the next master of the guild will be.</p>
<h4>S Class Wizards</h4>
<p><strong>An</strong> S-Class Wizard is a powerful Wizard that is recognized by the Guild Master and is able to undertake S-Class Jobs, and despite the very good pay, they are considered to be so dangerous that even the simplest mistake can cost them their life.The overall strength of S-Class Wizards differs from guild to guild. In some instances, an S-Class Wizard is considered the strongest within their respective guilds, as with the case of Gildarts.</p>
<h4>Wizards</h4>
<p><strong>Wizards</strong>Are are simply users of Magic that are able to undertake Jobs. Regular Mages are not allowed to undertake S-Class Jobs unless they are under the supervision of an S-Class Wizard. However, it is possible for them to become an S-Class Wizard. Fairy Tail’s guild is known to have a special tournament to decide whether or not a Wizard can be promoted. No other known events have been seen or mentioned with other guilds.</p>
